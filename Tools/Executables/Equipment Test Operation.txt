  Equipment Test Operation:
    - This program uses the eggsas.ini file.  There for EGGSAS must be installed in the
      standard place on the computer.
    - Select the Start Equipment Test button to start the test.
    - Select the Stop Equipment Test button to stop the test.
    - For the test to pass, the signal for both channels must be stable for
      2 minutes.  The time is specified in the eggsas.ini file "stabletime=120  ; seconds".
        - EGG stability:  Max signal must be within 1000 microvolts of the min signal.
             Specified in eggsas.ini file "stableEGGwindow=500 ; microvolts"
        - Respiration stability: Max signal must be within 400 microvolts of the min signal.
             Specified in eggsas.ini file "stableRespwindow=200 ; microvolts"
    - Errors:
        Hardware not connected at start of test.
        Driver (or part of) is missing.
        Hardware disconnected during test.
          Error is no signal.
        Respiration and/or EGG signals do not settle.
    - Status window:
        Shows any errors.
        Shows if test is stopped by the stop button.
        Shows if both signals have settled (test passed)
    - Does not detect:
        If a lead (or all leads) is disconnected.
        If one channel (EGG or Respiration) is working but not the other.
          It will show an error of no signal.
