Description of classes for the Orphan File Recovery Program

/********************************************************************
OrphanFileRecoveryDlg.cpp
Implementation file for the main dialog box.

  Operation:
    - Find the orphaned data files and list them.
    - Include an orphaned data file in the database.
      This may require more input from the user.
      - All studies:
        Ask user if the name is a research reference number or a patient name.
      - WaterLoad study:
        . If there were extra minutes (or periods) in the study,
          ask the user to specify the number of minutes in the baseline
          and postwater study.
      - Incomplete or cancelled study
         . Ask if user wants to include the study anyway.
           For a research, if adding a cancelled study, add it as a paused study.
           
Methods:

OnInitDialog
  Initialize class data.
  Set up the orphan file list box.
  Find orphan files.
------------------------------------------------
iFind_orphan_files - Message handler for the WMUSER_FIND_ORPHAN_FILES
                     user message.

          Find the orphaned files.
            Method: Go through each file in the data directory and check to
                    see if its in the database.  If it is in the database
                    and the file is valid (see the description for
                    bValidate_data_file() function), add it to the orphan
                    file listbox.
          Add to the orphan file listbox: patient name, date of study
            and type of study (research or waterload) or each orphan
            file found.

inputs: Not used.
        Not used.

return: 0
------------------------------------------------
OnBnClickedBtnAddSelToDb - Handler for the "Add Selection to Database" button.

- Read the selected data file and validate the header.
- Calculate the baseline minutes and post-stimulation minutes.
- If the baseline is too short or there is not enough data points in either
  the baseline or post-stimulation data, display a message to ask if the
  user still wants to add to the database.  For a research study, if it was
  cancelled, it can be added as a paused study.
- Ask the user if the patient name is a patient name or a researh number.
------------------------------------------------
vInit_patient_data - Initialize all data associated with a patient.
                         
  inputs: None.

  return: None.
------------------------------------------------
bValidate_data_file - Validate a data file. Open the file and read
                      it.  Then make sure the header is valid and there
                      are data points in the file.
                         
  inputs: CString object containing the file name.

  return: true if the file is valid.
          false if no data points, the file header is invalid or there
            was a file error.
------------------------------------------------

/********************************************************************
NameResearchNum.cpp
  Implementation file for the Patient Name/Research Reference Number dialog box.

  Operation:
    - Display the name on the study from the study file name.
    - There are 2 checkboxes, one to use the name as a patient name and the other
      to use the name as a research reference number.  One of the checkboxes is
      always checked (i.e. the user cannot uncheck both checkboxes).
    - One of the checkboxes is initially checked based based on the following:
      . If there is a space in the name, it is most likely a patient name
        and the patient name checkbox is checked.
      . If there is no space in the name, it is most likely a research reference
        number and that checkbox is checked.
    - The user can change the default selection.

Methods:

OnInitDialog

  Initialize class data.
  Decide which checkbox should be checked.
------------------------------------------------
OnBnClickedChkPatientName - Handler for the "Patient Name" checkbox.

If the checkbox has been checked, uncheck the research reference number
  checkbox.
If the checkbox has been unchecked (it was checked which means that the
  research reference number checkbox is unchecked), check it again to
  make sure one of the checkboxes is always checked.
------------------------------------------------
OnBnClickedChkResearchNum - Handler for the "Research Reference Number" checkbox.

If the checkbox has been checked, uncheck the patient name checkbox.
If the checkbox has been unchecked (it was checked which means that the
  patient name checkbox is unchecked), check it again to make sure one
  of the checkboxes is always checked.

/********************************************************************
WaterLoadInfo.cpp
  Implementation file for the WaterLoad information dialog box.

  Operation:
    - Used only for a waterload study.
    - Display the total minutes in the study.
    - The user must enter the baseline and post-waterload minutes in multiples
      of 10 minutes.
    - If the baseline minutes and the post-waterload minutes don't add up to
      the total minuteS, an error message is displayed.

Methods:

OnInitDialog

  Initialize class data.
------------------------------------------------
OnBnClickedOk - Handler for the "OK" button.

- Make sure the baseline and post-waterload study minutes add up to the
  total minutes.
- If the minutes don't add up, display an error message and don't exit
  the dialog box.
- If the minutes add up, exit the dialog box.

/********************************************************************
DataFile.cpp
  Implementation file for the CDataFile class.

  This class performs file I/O for the data file.
  It also parses the file name for the patient name and date of study.

Methods:

iRead - Read a data file.
        Saves the header and baseline trailer information and the total
          number of data points in the file.

  inputs: None.

  return: SUCCESS if the file is read with no errors.
          FAIL if there was an error, the class variable contains
            the error message.
------------------------------------------------
iOpen_file_get_hdr - Opens a data file, reads and saves the header information.

  inputs: None.

  return: SUCCESS if the file is read with no errors.
          FAIL if there was an error and the class variable contains
            the error message.
------------------------------------------------
bIsValid_hdr - Validates the header read from the file for the
               file version number and the program version that created
               it.

  inputs: None.

  return: true if the header is OK, false if the file version or the
          program version is wrong.
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
iAdd_baseline_trailer - Add a baseline trailer to the data file.  This
