DataFileViewerDlg.cpp
  Implementation file for the main dialog box.

  Operation:
    - Select a data file.
    - Read the data file and fill in the various fields.
    - Read the database if the study is a waterload and the
      baseline and/or the post-waterload has been extended.
      If the study is not in the database, fill in the default minutes
      and display a status message indicating the number of extra minutes
      in the study.

Methods:

OnInitDialog

  Create the data file class.
  Create the utility class.
------------------------------------------------
Handler for the "Select Data File" button.

  Display a file selection dialog box.
  Save the selected file (including the path).
------------------------------------------------
Handler for the "Read Data File" button.

  Read the data file and validate the data file header.
  Display the information from the data file.
------------------------------------------------
vDisplay_data - Display the data from the data file.
                Calculate the baseline and post-stimulation lengths.

                If this is a waterload study and its incomplete, an attempt
                is made to assign the minutes in the study to baseline and
                post-waterload.  In addition a status message is displayed
                indicating the total minutes in the study.

                For a research study, indicate through a status message:
                - If there are not enough minutes in the baseline or post-stimulation
                  study to analyze (need at least 4 minutes).
                - If the study was paused.
                - If the study was cancelled.

  inputs: None.

  return: None.
------------------------------------------------
vGet_db_info - Get the information needed from the database for this
               study.

               This is used only when the study is a waterload study and
               either the baseline and/or the postwater study has been extended
               for 10 minutes.  In this case, the number of periods is 4 (1 for
               the baseline and 3 for the postwater study) plus 1 period for
               each 10 minute extension.

               The database is read only for the period lengths.
               - Normal periods is 4. Periods to decide is Periods in study
                 minus the normal periods.
               - If the baseline period length is 20 minutes then the baseline has
                 been extended for 10 minutes or 1 period.  Subtract 1 from the
                 periods to decide.
               - The remaining periods to decide is the number of periods the
                 postwater study has been extended.

               If the database can't be accessed or the study isn't in the database,
               a status message is displayed that indicates the number of extra minutes
               in the study.

  inputs: Number of 10 minute periods in the study.
          Pointer to the number of minutes in the baseline.  This gets changed
            if the baseline has an extra 10 minute period.
          Pointer to the number of minutes in the postwater study.  This gets changed
            if the postwater study has one or more extra 10 minute periods.

  return: None.

DataFile.cpp
  Implementation file for the CDataFile class.

  This class performs file I/O for the data file.
  It also parses the file name for the patient name and date of study.

Methods:

iRead - Read a data file.
        Saves the header and baseline trailer information and the total
          number of data points in the file.

  inputs: None.

  return: SUCCESS if the file is read with no errors.
          FAIL if there was an error, the class variable contains
            the error message.
------------------------------------------------
iOpen_file_get_hdr - Opens a data file, reads and saves the header information.

  inputs: None.

  return: SUCCESS if the file is read with no errors.
          FAIL if there was an error and the class variable contains
            the error message.
------------------------------------------------
bIsValid_hdr - Validates the header read from the file for the
               file version number and the program version that created
               it.

  inputs: None.

  return: true if the header is OK, false if the file version or the
          program version is wrong.
------------------------------------------------
vClose_file - Close the data file if it is open.

  inputs: None.

  return: None.
------------------------------------------------
bIsResearch_study - Determine if the data file contains a research or
                    waterload study.

  inputs: None.

  return: true if a research study, false if a waterload study.
------------------------------------------------
cstrDate_of_study - Get the date of the study from the file name.
                    Format: mm/dd/yyyy

  inputs: None.

  return: CString object containing the date of the study.
------------------------------------------------
cstrGet_name - Get the patient name from the file name.
               Format: FirstName MI LastName

  inputs: None.

  return: CString object containing the patient name.
------------------------------------------------
iAdd_baseline_trailer - Add a baseline trailer to the data file.  This
                        makes a cancelled research study a paused study.

  inputs: None.

  return: SUCCESS if the baseline trailer was added.
          FAIL if there was an error.
